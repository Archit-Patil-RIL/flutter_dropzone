# flutter_dropzone_web

The web implementation of [`flutter_dropzone`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package is the endorsed implementation of `flutter_dropzone` for the web platform, so it gets automatically added to your dependencies by depending on `flutter_dropzone`.

No modifications to your `pubspec.yaml` should be required in a recent enough version of Flutter (`>=1.12.13+hotfix.4`):

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_dropzone: ^1.0.0
  ...
```

Once you have `flutter_dropzone` in `pubspec.yaml` you should be able to use `package:flutter_dropzone` as normal.
